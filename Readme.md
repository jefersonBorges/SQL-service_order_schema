### Database

#### Maintenance orders

The service request is generated by a requester, being approved by the administrator, the service order is generated. The service order can be carried out by one or more maintainers and use more than one spare part. When using any material, a service request must be generated for the warehouse sector for control. In the service order, the parts and hours of work are accounted for in order to apportion the maintenance costs by sector. Values for hours of service and parts follow preset tables provided by the customer's system. The request opening and approval dates are necessary to measure the service time.
